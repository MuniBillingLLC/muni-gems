# 502 Bad Gateway
# This error is usually due to improperly configured proxy servers. However, the problem may
# also arise when there is poor IP communication between backâ€”end computers, when the client's
# server is overloaded, or when a firewall is functioning improperly.
#
# The first step in resolving the issue is to clear the client's cache. This action should result
# in a different proxy being used to resolve the web server's content.
